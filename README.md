# Radar-system-using-an-Arduino
demonstrates a radar system using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a servo motor to create a sweeping radar that detects objects and displays the output on a computer screen using the Processing IDE.
# Components Needed
Arduino Uno 

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor - (for distance measurement)

Servo Motor - for sweeping the Ultrasonic sensor

Jumper Wires and Breadboard

Processing IDE - for visualization on a computer
